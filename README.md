Welcome to the Molecule Visualizer, a comprehensive software tool that allows users to visualize molecules in high-quality 3D graphics. This program is designed with the combination of Python, C, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL, and utilizes Swig to link C and Python libraries. With this program, users can upload an SDF file containing the desired molecule and enter elements to visualize them in stunning detail.

The program employs a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to access and use the software. Once the user has uploaded the SDF file and entered the desired elements, the program uses Python to parse the file and retrieve the necessary information about the molecule. The retrieved data is then sent to the C library, where it is processed and visualized in high-quality 3D graphics.

In addition to its visualization capabilities, the program also offers a range of customization options, allowing users to adjust the visual properties of the molecule, such as color and radius. Furthermore, the program offers a wide range of viewing options, allowing users to view the molecule from different angles and perspectives.

The Molecule Visualizer uses SQL to store user preferences and molecule data, allowing for quick and easy access to previously visualized molecules. Additionally, the program employs HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Overall, the Molecule Visualizer is a powerful and versatile program that offers users a comprehensive set of tools for visualizing molecules in high-quality 3D graphics.
